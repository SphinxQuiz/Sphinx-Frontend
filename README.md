<h1>Why ?</h1>

<p>Learning new thing is always a fun thing right ?</p>
<p> I love the game trivial pursuit and i wanted to make an application where I could learn new things with some cool features like a leaderboard and some stats.</p>
<h1>How ?</h1>
<p>I didn't want to code my website using PHP or Mysql as we learned with the IUT. I wanted to first of all learn something new and more important some recent technologies. That's why i decided to learn how to build node js api and mongo db</p>
<p>I learned node js and mongodb with open classroom and I love it !</p>
